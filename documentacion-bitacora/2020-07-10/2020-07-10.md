## notes:
reunion from 10:45 to 11:30

spent about 5 hours working in the client panel, finalizing all the elements.

Notably the hardest things to get working were the gridview, the modals, and the javascript functions

I have determined that for json parsing ill use newtonsoft.json library

Since the admin panel is more complex, i learned that you can use UserControl to reuse aspx code. I am learning it. My goal is to rewrite all the existing admin pages with this user control. however this is not necesarily something i'll do in this project

For the datepicker I was gonna use the native ASP text box set to 'date' mode, however, it exclusively uses the mm-dd-yyyy format, which will cause headaches when passing it to the database. So I'll find a javascript alternative.
