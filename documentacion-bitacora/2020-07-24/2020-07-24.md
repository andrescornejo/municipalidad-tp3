## Notes:
Connection string for dekstop: 
Data Source=HOTHEAD\SQLEXPRESS;Initial Catalog=municipalidad;Integrated Security=True

Connection string for laptop:
Data Source=HUSTLEBONES\SQLEXPRESS;Initial Catalog=municipalidad;Integrated Security=True

## Problems:
Connection string stopped working. I have no clue why. Spent around 50 minutes debugging, the fix was to paste the connection string in code. Not secure, but I don't care at this point.
