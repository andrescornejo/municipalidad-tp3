### Work time: 

## TODO:
- [x] Working checkboxes in gridview.
- [ ] Mandar info de gridview a base de datos.
- [ ] SPs that handle validation and payments.
- [ ] Comprobante de pago despliega el recibo.

## notes:
Postbacks are a pain in the rear. Since I am not running this application in a web server, sometimes it's hard for me to know what I should run in the server side, and what I should run in the client side.
